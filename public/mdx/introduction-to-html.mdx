## Basic HTML Document Structure

An HTML document has a basic structure that includes the following elements:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Header</h1>
    <p>Paragraph text...</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines the document type as HTML5.
- The `<html>` element is the root element of the page, and all other elements are nested within it.
- The `<head>` element contains metadata about the page, such as the page title (displayed in the browser tab).
- The `<body>` element contains the content that is displayed on the page.

## HTML Elements

HTML elements are used to define the structure and content of a web page. Some common elements include:

- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: header elements used to define headings.
- `<p>`: used to define paragraphs of text.
- `<a>`: used to create links to other pages or resources.
- `<img>`: used to embed images in a web page.
- `<ul>` and `<li>`: used to create bulleted lists.
- `<ol>` and `<li>`: used to create numbered lists.

Here's an example of how these elements might be used in an HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is a sample web page created using HTML.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Item 1</li>
      <li>Item 2</li>
      <li>Item 3</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.example.com">Click here</a> to visit a different
      website.
    </p>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="A sample image" />
  </body>
</html>
```

## Conclusion

HTML is an essential building block for creating websites and web applications. With its simple syntax and wide range of elements, it provides a flexible and powerful way to define the structure and content of a web page. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, a solid understanding of HTML is essential for creating engaging and effective web pages.# Introduction to HTML
